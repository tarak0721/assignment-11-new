Q3. How do class decorators overlap with metaclasses for handling classes?
 Anything you can do with a class decorator, you can of course do with a custom metaclasses (just apply the functionality of the "decorator function", i.e., the one that takes a class object and modifies it, in the course of the metaclass's __new__ or __init__ that make the class object!).
